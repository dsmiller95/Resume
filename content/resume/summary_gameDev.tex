Seeking a lateral move into the game development industry as an Engine programmer.
I thrive on solving complex problems and am looking for a team that values autonomy and creativity.
Expert in C\#, Unity, Terraform, Dotnet Core, and Typescript. Currently learning Neovim and Rust. 

Most recently I was a senior software engineer at financial startup Dispute.com and founder of Fraculation LLC.\@
I have 9 years of professional experience and have been writing code since 2010. My experience is varied, starting with 
full stack development in C\# and Angular across both AWS and Azure, then teaching myself high-performance Unity and Rust.
Over the past year I have organizing teams around 8 Game Jams with varied levels of success.
