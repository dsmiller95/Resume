Senior software engineer at financial startup Dispute.com and founder of Fraculation LLC.\@
I have 9 years of professional experience and have been writing code since 2010. My experience is varied, starting with 
full stack development in C\# and Angular across both AWS and Azure, then teaching myself high-performance Unity and Rust,
most recently organizing teams around Game Jams.

Expert in C\#, Unity, Terraform, Dotnet Core, and Typscript. Currently learning Vim, Rust and Game Development. 
Looking to make a lateral move into games or adjacent industry as an Engine programmer, 
Tools engineer,  Systems designer, Backend engineer, or generalist programmer.
I thrive on solving complex problems and am looking for a team that values autonomy and creativity.
