Senior software engineer at financial startup Dispute.com and founder of Fraculation LLC.\@
I have 9 years of professional experience and have been writing code since 2010. My experience is varied, starting with 
full stack development in C\# and Angular across both AWS and Azure, then teaching myself high-performance Unity and Rust,
most recently organizing teams around Game Jams.

Currently learning Vim, Rust and Game Design. Expert in C\#, Unity, dotnet core, Typscript, and Terraform.
Looking to make a lateral move into games or adjacent industry as an Engine programmer, 
Tools engineer,  Systems designer, Backend engineer, Gameplay programmer, or generalist programmer.
I am highly self-motivated particularly when working on hard problems, 
and am looking for a team that values autonomy and creativity.
