Most recently a lead software engineer at financial startup Dispute.com and founder of Fraculation LLC.\@
I have 9 years of professional experience and have been writing code since 2010. My experience is varied, starting with 
full stack development in C\# and Angular across both AWS and Azure, then learning real-time application development in C\# and Rust,
and most recently leading the development of a real-time financial dispute resolution platform built with C\# and dotnet core.

Expert in C\#, Terraform, Dotnet Core, Typescript, and Unity. Currently learning Neovim and Rust. 
Looking to solve complex and meaningful problems with a team that values autonomy and creativity.
Ideally working in performance-critical and/or high scale contexts on the Individual Contributor track.
