Senior software engineer at financial startup Dispute.com and founder of Fraculation LLC.\@
I have 9 years of professional experience and have been writing code since 2010. My experience is varied, starting with 
full stack development in C\# and Angular across both AWS and Azure, then teaching myself real-time application development in C\# and Rust,
most recently leading development of a real-time financial dispute resolution platform built with C\# and dotnet core.



Expert in C\#, Unity, Terraform, Dotnet Core, and Typscript. Currently learning Vim and Rust. 
Looking to solve complex and meaninful problems with a team who values autonomy and creativity.
Ideally working with Rust or C\# on a cloud-native platform on the Individual Contributor track.
