I am a senior software engineer at Milwaukee Tool and founder of Fraculation LLC.\@
Currently I am building full-stack applications in C\# and React with a focus on clean architecture and maximum feature velocity.
I have 9 years of professional experience and have been writing code since 2010. My experience is varied, starting with 
full stack development in C\#, Angular, AWS, and Azure, then learning real-time application development in C\# and Rust,
and later leading the development of a real-time financial dispute resolution platform built with dotnet core.

Expert in C\#, Terraform, Dotnet Core, Typescript, and Unity. Currently learning Neovim and Rust. 
Looking to solve complex and meaningful problems with a team that values autonomy and creativity.
Ideally working in performance-critical and/or high scale contexts on the Individual Contributor track.
